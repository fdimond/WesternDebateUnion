# WesternDebateUnion

### Purpose
<p>
As a member of WWU's debate team, I saw a need for centralized information about our team to the public and ourselves. I used it as an opportunity to buff my design skills and learn the intricacies of Jquery libraries.

### What I learned
<p>
From a design perspective, I really enjoyed the interplay of paper in this project. Debate is the type of sport that lacks striking iconography due to its systems of play existing abstractly. I tried to sell the feeling of paper moving across desks; a unique tangible expression within debate.   
<br>
The library you choose is important. I found limitations in my chosen Jquery library used for movement and animation. This movement ended up playing a crucial role that I did not forsee at the start of the project. Knowing this, I would have chosen a Jquery library with more depth and control for animation.
